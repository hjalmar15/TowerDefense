# Tower Defense

This is the classic game of Tower Defense written in Python by:
- Arnar Jóhannsson    
- Egill Benediktsson
- Hjálmar Diego Arnórsson
    
### Object of the game:
Place towers on the map to prevent the creeps from completing the path and entering your sacred kingdom.
There are four types of creeps: Yellow, Green, Blue and Red which all have different attributes.
For each creep you kill you get a certain score and reward, which varies between creeps.
You also get a reward for each wave that starts. You can then use the rewards to buy towers.
There are three different towers which all have their unique attributes:
- Bomber: Medium speed, damage and range
- Shooter: High speed, low damage and range. Shoots all creeps in range simultaneously.
- Sniper: Slow speed, high damage and range but expensive
